This mod automatically unequips your helmet, and coif when starting a conversation with an NPC, then re-equips them when the dialog ends.

Install this mod using Vortex from Nexus Mods.


[size=4]Alternative version[/size]

The optional files section offers a version that unequips helmets in random dialogues rather than all of them. For instance, it might remove the helmet in one conversation but keep it on in the next. As a player, this reflects my reason for creating this mod—half because I expect I’ll grow tired of Henry’s face, and half because the helmets are really cool to look at, especially when switching between different ones.


[size=4]Things to Know[/size]
[list]
[*] [b]Charisma Impact[/b]: Unequipping the helmet or coif during dialogue most probably lower charisma, as these items contribute to that stat. I don’t plan to address this, as high charisma is achievable without them, and it’s an acceptable trade-off for the mod’s functionality.
[*] [b]Not All Helmets[/b]: I play slowly (still on the first KCD 2 map after a restart), so I haven’t tested every helmet yet. That said, this mod should work with at least 90% of helmets—like kettles, and bascinets. If you find one that doesn’t work, please let me know so I can address it.
[*] [b]Non-Helmet Items[/b]: Gear like hats remains unaffected by this mod.
